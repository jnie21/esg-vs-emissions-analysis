# ESG vs. Emissions: Does Corporate Reputation Match Reality?

This project investigates whether high ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores actually reflect better environmental performance, as measured by carbon emissions. Using real-world data, I analyze patterns across industries to uncover gaps between ESG ratings and emissions output.

## 🎯 Why It Matters
ESG scores guide over $35 trillion in global assets — shaping investment flows, regulatory frameworks, and corporate strategy. Yet critics argue that ESG scores can be misleading — rewarding companies for disclosure rather than performance. If ESG scores fail to reflect actual environmental impact — such as carbon emissions — the entire foundation of ESG investing may be vulnerable to greenwashing, mispriced risk, and public mistrust. This project investigates whether those concerns are backed by data.

## 📊 What This Project Does

- Imports and cleans a dataset of ESG scores and emissions
- Visualizes ESG vs. CO₂ emissions across companies and sectors
- Identifies industries and firms where ESG scores are misaligned with actual impact
- Summarizes implications for investors, regulators, and public-sector economists

## 📁 Data Source

- [Kaggle: ESG Scores and Emissions Dataset (2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankurzing/esg-score-csv)

## 🧰 Tools Used

- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- dplyr

## 🔍 Key Questions

- Are higher ESG scores consistently associated with lower emissions?
- Which sectors or firms score high but pollute heavily?
- What does this suggest about ESG as a regulatory or investment tool?

## 📌 Relevance

This project sits at the intersection of environmental policy, corporate transparency, and economic analysis. It aims to inform discussions on sustainable finance, greenwashing, and regulatory reform — making it relevant to public-sector analysts, consulting firms, and financial institutions alike.
